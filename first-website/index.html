        <p>The hand has become increasingly less present in the web as we know it today. Most websites today are built from templates on website-building platforms, and the knowledge of how to make a website from scratch is relegated to a select few. <br>
<br>
<br>       
<br>
It has only grown easier to learn how to make websites, but the perceived requirements and expectations for a website have become so convoluted and arcane that many avoid the subject.The first part of the class will be technically focused. It will be comprised of a series of lessons, readings, workshops, and small projects to develop familiarity and confidence with the language of the web. We’ll focus on the basic languages of web development: HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript. </p>
